Leapcards code from Unhackathon, Fall 2014
2nd Place, User Experience

This repo contains all code from the Leapcards application developed by Aditya Dalal, Emily Pries, and Will Welch at Unhackathon, a student hackathon at AlleyNYC.

A connected Leap Motion controller is required to use this application.

Leapcards is an interactive flashcard web application that allows users to engage arithmetic and multiple choice questions kinesthetically by using the Leap Motion controller. The application supports differentiated learning with multiple difficulties. While we designed the easy-to-use interface with children in mind, it is a fun memorization tool for users of any age who want to use their minds and bodies and the same time. We hope that this small application will excite its users about the possibilities presented by emerging technologies in the classroom.

We were proud to recieve a prize for 2nd Place for User Experience at the conclusion of the weekend. If and when we return to Leapcards, we'd like to add a front-end teacher/user interface to input personalized questions and answers as well as session analytics.

PLEASE NOTE: If this unedited code looks like it was written by time-crunched, sleep-deprived programmers who had never used a Leap Motion controller before... remember that it was!
